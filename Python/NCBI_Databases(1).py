#### NCBI Databases

# Aims:

# Learn about the different databases the NCBI has available
# Understand the XML language
# Using biopython to communicate with these databases

# Entrez and NCBI databases
# Working with these databases online
# XML
#  Biopython

#### Entrez
# ▪ Molecular database system of the NCBI (National center of
# biotechnology information) in the US
# ▪ Provides access to a multitude of different databases like
# Genome, Nucleotide, PubMed and so on
# ▪ Give you even access to Structural data of proteins via the
# PDB
# ▪ Can be used to find nearly all information about a specific
# biochemical, medical or biotechnological subject


#### Entrez Literature
# ▪ Combines literature for the search topic in the databases
#  Bookshelf which contains, as the name implies, many books, either
# physical ones or ebooks
#  MeSH for medical subject headings, that means medical articles
#  NLM catalog that provides access to the contents of the National
# Library of Medicine
#  PubMed a comprehensive database of citations of scientific articles
# from different journals
#  PubMed central an electronic archive of scientific articles

#### Entrez Genes
#  Gives you information about the genes of a search topic in
#  Gene an integrated database collection information about the
# nomenclature, reference sequences and links to resources
#  GEO Datasets that stores curated gene data sets
#  GEO Profiles that stores individual gene expressions from the
# curated datasets of GEO Datasets
#  HomoloGene an automated system for constructing putative
# homology groups from the complete gene sets
#  PopSet a collection of related DNA sequences derived from
# population, phylogenetic, mutation and ecosystem studies

#### Entrez Protein
# ▪ Allows you to access protein data for the search topic in:
#  Conserved Domains a database for the annotation of functional units
# in proteins
#  Identical protein Groups that contains a single entry for each protein
# translation found in the NCBI resources
#  Protein a collection of sequences from several sources
#  Protein Family Models a collection of models representing
# homologous proteins with a common function
#  Structure a database for three dimensional protein structures

####Entrez Genomes
# ▪ You can find information about genomes of a search topic in
#  Assembly providing information on the structure of assembled
# genomes
#  BioCollections a curated dataset of metadata for culture collections,
# museums, herbaria and other natural history collections
#  BioProject a collection of biological data related to a single initiative
#  BioSample contains descriptions of biological source materials used
# in experimental assays
#  Genome organizes information on genomes including sequences,
# maps, chromosomes, assemblies, and annotations

# You can find information about genomes of a search topic in
#  Nucleotide a collection of sequences from several sources, including
# GenBank, RefSeq, TPA and PDB
#  SRA the largest publicly available repository of high throughput
# sequencing data
#  Taxonomy a curated classification and nomenclature for all of the
# organisms in the public sequence databases


#### Entrez Clinical
# ▪ You can find clinical data for a specific topic in
#  ClinicalTrials a database of privately and publicly funded clinical
# studies conducted around the world
#  ClinVar aggregates information about genomic variation
#  dbGaP the database of Genotypes and Phenotype in humans
#  dbVar a database of human genomic Structural Variation
#  GTR a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test
# information
#  MedGen organizes information related to human medical genetics
#  OMIM a comprehensive, authoritative compendium of human genes

#### PubChem
# ▪ Entrez also gives you access to PubChem
# ▪ The world's largest collection of freely accessible chemical
# information
# ▪ Search chemicals by name, molecular formula, structure,
# and other identifiers
# ▪ You can find information about Compounds, pathways,
# BioAssays, Substances of a specific search topic
